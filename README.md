DijkstrasAlgorithm
==================

Implement the shortest path algorithm for a network of gossip.


How to implement on a webserver (from Amazon's website using EC2): 

- Create an AMI containing your applications, libraries, data, and associated configuration settings.
- Configure security and network access on your Amazon EC2 instance.
- Choose which instance type(s) you want, then start, terminate, and monitor as many instances of your AMI as needed, using the web service APIs or the variety of management tools provided.
- Determine whether you want to run in multiple locations, utilize static IP endpoints, or attach persistent block storage to your instances.
